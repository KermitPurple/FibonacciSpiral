# Fibonacci Sprial
I created this program to display the Fibonacci spiral expanding. I got the idea from [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/GoldenSpiralLogarithmic_color_in.gif). I used freeGLUT to create this program and you can find the download [here](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
Originally, I was going to use the formula of a quarter circle y = sqrt(r^2 - x^2). BUTTT that died. It might work, but there was no way i was gonna figure it out. so I used the formula for a quadratic bezier curve, and that worked instantly. I'm mad I didn't do that earler.
